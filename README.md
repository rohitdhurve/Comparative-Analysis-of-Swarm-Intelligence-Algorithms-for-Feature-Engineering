# Comparative Analysis of Swarm Intelligence Algorithms for Feature Engineering
This project aims to enhance the prediction accuracy of the NIFTY50 index by employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in conjunction with feature selection techniques based on (ACO, GA, BHO). The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these optimization algorithms in improving the performance of LSTM models for financial forecasting.
